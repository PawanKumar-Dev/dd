## [2.5.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

#### Pending Domains Management System

- **Enhanced ResellerClub API Response Handling**: Added logic to detect "Order Locked for Processing" responses and mark domains as pending
- **Domain Verification Service**: Comprehensive service to verify domain registration success by checking availability
- **Pending Domains Database Model**: Complete MongoDB schema for tracking pending domain registrations
- **Admin Pending Domains Interface**: Full-featured admin dashboard for managing pending domains
- **Automatic Pending Domain Creation**: Domains with failed registrations are automatically added to pending list
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Shows "Domain registration is being processed" instead of technical errors

#### TLD-Specific Validation System

- **Minimum Registration Period Validation**: Automatic validation of TLD-specific minimum registration requirements
- **Dynamic Cart Interface**: Registration period dropdown adapts based on TLD requirements
- **Pre-payment Validation**: Prevents payment processing for invalid registration periods
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear warnings and minimum period indicators in cart and checkout
- **TLD Support**: Comprehensive support for .ai (2+ years), .co (2+ years), and standard TLDs (1+ year)

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/pending-domains` - List pending domains with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/admin/pending-domains` - Create new pending domain record
- `GET /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]` - Get specific pending domain details
- `PUT /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]` - Update pending domain status/notes
- `DELETE /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]` - Delete pending domain record
- `POST /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]/register` - Manually register a pending domain
- `POST /api/admin/pending-domains/verify` - Batch verify multiple domains

#### Enhanced Features

- **Dual Detection Methods**: Enhanced API response parsing + domain availability verification
- **Immediate Detection**: "Order Locked for Processing" responses are caught immediately
- **Proactive Management**: Domains are added to pending list before verification
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple domains for batch verification
- **Status Tracking**: Complete audit trail of registration attempts and status changes

### Changed

#### Payment Verification System

- **Enhanced Error Detection**: Now detects error messages even in successful HTTP responses
- **Improved Status Handling**: "Order Locked for Processing" responses are marked as pending instead of successful
- **User Experience**: Customer-facing messages are now user-friendly instead of technical
- **Automatic Pending Creation**: Domains with pending status are immediately added to pending domains list
- **"Already Exists" Error Handling**: Enhanced detection of "already exists in database" errors as pending status

#### User Interface Improvements

- **Checkout Page Redesign**: Complete redesign using cart page layout pattern for stability
- **Layout Stability**: Fixed layout shifting issues with consistent grid system
- **Cart Experience**: Removed unnecessary messages and streamlined user flow
- **Payment Flow**: Improved payment button states and progress indicators

#### Domain Verification Logic

- **Better Domain Parsing**: Properly splits domain into base domain and TLD
- **Correct Search Method**: Uses `searchDomainWithTlds()` for accurate results
- **Partial Match Detection**: Handles cases where API returns unexpected formats
- **Conservative Approach**: Marks uncertain cases as pending for manual verification

#### Admin Navigation

- **New Menu Item**: Added "Pending Domains" to admin navigation with AlertTriangle icon
- **Integrated Layout**: Pending domains page uses consistent AdminLayoutNew component

### Fixed

#### ResellerClub API Integration

- **"Order Locked for Processing" Detection**: Fixed issue where domains with this response were marked as successful
- **Error Message Parsing**: Enhanced logic to detect various error conditions that indicate pending status
- **Domain Availability Verification**: Fixed domain search logic to properly handle domain name parsing
- **"Already Exists" Error Recognition**: Fixed issue where "already exists in database" errors were marked as failed instead of pending

#### Customer Experience

- **Technical Error Messages**: Replaced technical error messages with user-friendly ones
- **Status Transparency**: Customers now see appropriate "processing" messages instead of confusing errors
- **Layout Shifting**: Fixed checkout page layout shifting when payment button states change
- **Cart Preservation**: Improved cart preservation during payment cancellation/failure
- **Unnecessary Messages**: Removed redundant messages from cart and checkout pages

#### Payment Processing

- **ReferenceError Fix**: Fixed `customerResult is not defined` error in payment verification
- **Scope Issues**: Moved customer creation outside loop to prevent scope conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for TLD-specific registration failures

### Technical Improvements

#### Code Quality

- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging domain verification
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for API failures and edge cases
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for pending domain management
- **Performance**: Optimized batch operations with rate limiting
