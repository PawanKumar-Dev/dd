# Pending Domains Management Feature

## Overview

This feature addresses the issue where ResellerClub API doesn't provide reliable wallet balance information or proper error responses for insufficient funds. Instead of relying on API error messages, we implement a workaround that detects failed domain registrations by checking domain availability after registration attempts.

## Problem Statement

- ResellerClub API doesn't throw proper responses for insufficient funds
- ResellerClub support confirmed they have no way to confirm wallet details
- Domain registrations can fail silently due to low wallet balance
- Users don't get notified about failed registrations
- Admins have no visibility into pending/failed registrations

## Solution

### 1. Domain Verification Service (`lib/domain-verification.ts`)

A service that verifies domain registration success by checking domain availability:

- **`verifyDomainRegistration(domainName)`**: Checks if a domain is still available after registration attempt
- **`verifyMultipleDomains(domainNames)`**: Batch verification with rate limiting
- **`isPendingRegistration(result)`**: Determines if a domain registration is pending
- **`getVerificationSummary(results)`**: Provides summary statistics

**Logic:**

- If domain is still available → Registration likely failed (pending)
- If domain is no longer available → Registration successful
- If verification fails → Mark as failed

### 2. Pending Domains Database Model (`models/PendingDomain.ts`)

MongoDB schema for tracking pending domain registrations:

```typescript
interface IPendingDomain {
  domainName: string;
  price: number;
  currency: string;
  registrationPeriod: number;
  userId: string;
  orderId: string;
  customerId: number; // ResellerClub customer ID
  contactId: number; // ResellerClub contact ID
  nameServers?: string[];
  adminContactId?: number;
  techContactId?: number;
  billingContactId?: number;
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed";
  reason: string;
  verificationAttempts: number;
  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;
  registeredAt?: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
  resellerClubOrderId?: string;
  adminNotes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Admin Pending Domains Management

- **`GET /api/admin/pending-domains`**: List pending domains with filtering and pagination
- **`POST /api/admin/pending-domains`**: Create new pending domain record
- **`GET /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]`**: Get specific pending domain details
- **`PUT /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]`**: Update pending domain status/notes
- **`DELETE /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]`**: Delete pending domain record

#### Domain Registration

- **`POST /api/admin/pending-domains/[id]/register`**: Manually register a pending domain

#### Domain Verification

- **`POST /api/admin/pending-domains/verify`**: Batch verify multiple domains

### 4. Payment Verification Integration

Updated `app/api/payments/verify/route.ts` to:

1. **After domain registration attempts**: Verify all domains using `DomainVerificationService`
2. **Detect failed registrations**: If domain is still available, mark as pending
3. **Create pending records**: Automatically create `PendingDomain` records for failed registrations
4. **Update order status**: Mark domains as "pending" in the original order

### 5. Admin Interface (`app/admin/pending-domains/page.tsx`)

Comprehensive admin dashboard for managing pending domains:

#### Features:

- **Status Summary Cards**: Total, Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed counts
- **Advanced Filtering**: By status, search by domain name or order ID
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple domains for batch verification
- **Individual Actions**:
  - View details
  - Manually register domain
  - Update status and notes
  - Delete record
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh data and status changes
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of pending domains

#### Status Management:

- **Pending**: Domain registration failed, needs manual intervention
- **Processing**: Admin is currently registering the domain
- **Completed**: Domain successfully registered
- **Failed**: Domain registration failed permanently

### 6. Navigation Integration

Added "Pending Domains" to admin navigation menu with AlertTriangle icon for visibility.

## Workflow

### 1. Payment Processing

```
User completes payment → Domain registration attempted →
Domain verification performed → Failed registrations detected →
Pending domain records created → Admin notified
```

### 2. Admin Management

```
Admin views pending domains → Reviews failed registrations →
Refills wallet funds → Manually registers domains →
Updates status to completed → Customer notified
```

### 3. Customer Experience

- **Frontend users**: No visibility into pending status (as requested)
- **Successful registrations**: Work normally
- **Failed registrations**: Appear as "pending" in user dashboard
- **Admin intervention**: Transparent to users

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Detection**: No longer dependent on unreliable API error messages
2. **Admin Visibility**: Clear dashboard for managing failed registrations
3. **Manual Recovery**: Admins can refill funds and retry registrations
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of registration attempts and status changes
5. **Batch Operations**: Efficient management of multiple pending domains
6. **User Experience**: Seamless experience for successful registrations

## Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiting

- Domain verification includes delays to avoid ResellerClub API rate limits
- Batch processing with configurable delays between requests

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Graceful degradation if verification fails
- Non-blocking pending domain creation

### Performance

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for large datasets
- Optimized batch operations

### Security

- Admin-only access to pending domains management
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization

## Usage

### For Admins:

1. Navigate to "Pending Domains" in admin panel
2. Review domains with "pending" status
3. Refill ResellerClub wallet funds
4. Use "Register" button to manually register domains
5. Monitor status changes and completion

### For Developers:

1. Domain verification is automatically triggered after payment verification
2. Pending domains are created automatically for failed registrations
3. Admin interface provides full CRUD operations
4. API endpoints support both individual and batch operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Notify admins when new pending domains are created
2. **Automated Retry**: Schedule automatic retry attempts for pending domains
3. **Wallet Monitoring**: Integration with ResellerClub wallet balance APIs
4. **Reporting**: Analytics and reporting on pending domain patterns
5. **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for status changes
