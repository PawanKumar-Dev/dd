# Enhanced Social Login - Auto Profile Population

## Overview

The social login system has been enhanced to automatically fetch and populate user profile information from Google and Facebook, significantly reducing the need for manual profile completion.

## What's New

### ✅ Auto-Populated Fields

When users sign in with **Google** or **Facebook**, the system now automatically fetches:

1. **Basic Info** (Always Available)
   - ✅ First Name
   - ✅ Last Name
   - ✅ Email Address

2. **Phone Number** (If Available)
   - ✅ Phone number from Google contacts
   - ✅ Mobile phone from Facebook profile
   - ✅ Auto-detects Indian format (+91)

3. **Address** (If Available)
   - ✅ Street address
   - ✅ City
   - ✅ State/Region
   - ✅ Country
   - ✅ Postal/ZIP code

## How It Works

### New User Registration (Google/Facebook)

```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
    ↓
Google OAuth authentication
    ↓
System requests additional permissions:
  - Phone numbers (user.phonenumbers.read)
  - Addresses (user.addresses.read)
    ↓
User grants permissions
    ↓
System fetches data from Google People API
    ↓
Profile automatically populated:
  ✅ Name: John Doe
  ✅ Email: john@gmail.com
  ✅ Phone: 9876543210 (+91)
  ✅ Address: 123 Main St, Mumbai, MH
    ↓
Check profile completeness:
  Has phone? YES
  Has address? YES
    ↓
profileCompleted: true ✅
    ↓
User goes directly to dashboard
NO profile completion prompt! 🎉
```

### Existing User Linking Social Account

```
User with existing account
Signs in with Google
    ↓
System finds existing user by email
    ↓
Fetches data from Google People API
    ↓
Auto-populate MISSING fields only:
  Phone: Not set → ✅ Updated
  Address: Already set → ⏭️ Skipped
  Name: Already set → ⏭️ Skipped
    ↓
Check profile completeness:
  profileCompleted: false → true ✅
    ↓
User profile automatically completed!
```

## API Integration

### Google People API

**Endpoint:**
```
GET https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me
?personFields=phoneNumbers,addresses
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "value": "+91 9876543210",
      "type": "mobile"
    }
  ],
  "addresses": [
    {
      "streetAddress": "123 Main Street",
      "city": "Mumbai",
      "region": "Maharashtra",
      "postalCode": "400001",
      "countryCode": "IN"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Facebook Graph API

**Endpoint:**
```
GET https://graph.facebook.com/me
?fields=mobile_phone,location{location{city,state,country,zip}}
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "mobile_phone": "+91 9876543210",
  "location": {
    "location": {
      "city": "Mumbai",
      "state": "Maharashtra",
      "country": "India",
      "zip": "400001"
    }
  }
}
```

## Profile Completion Logic

### Automatic Completion

Profile is marked as **complete** if:
- ✅ Phone number exists
- ✅ Phone country code exists
- ✅ Address line 1 exists
- ✅ City exists

### Smart Prompting

Users are **only prompted** to complete profile if:
- ❌ Missing phone number, OR
- ❌ Missing address

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Google User with Full Profile

```
User: John Doe
Google Account: Has phone and address saved
    ↓
Sign in with Google
    ↓
✅ Profile auto-completed
✅ Direct access to dashboard
✅ Can proceed to checkout immediately
NO manual input required!
```

### Scenario 2: Google User with Partial Profile

```
User: Jane Smith  
Google Account: Has phone but NO address
    ↓
Sign in with Google
    ↓
✅ Phone auto-populated
❌ Address missing
    ↓
⚠️ "Profile Completion Required"
📝 User fills: Address only
✅ Profile completed
```

### Scenario 3: Existing User Links Google

```
User: Previously registered manually
Profile: Incomplete (no phone)
    ↓
Sign in with Google
    ↓
✅ Phone auto-populated from Google
✅ Profile automatically marked complete
✅ Access granted
```

## Privacy & Security

### User Consent
- ✅ Users must explicitly grant permissions
- ✅ Google/Facebook shows what data is requested
- ✅ Users can deny specific permissions

### Data Handling
- ✅ Only fetched when user authenticates
- ✅ Stored securely in database
- ✅ Not shared with third parties
- ✅ Users can update/delete anytime

### Fallback Behavior
- If API calls fail → Silent fallback
- If permissions denied → Manual entry required
- If data unavailable → Prompt for completion

## Configuration Required

### Google Cloud Console

1. Enable **People API**
2. Add OAuth scopes:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.phonenumbers.read`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.addresses.read`

### Facebook App Dashboard

1. Add permissions:
   - `user_mobile_phone`
   - `user_location`
2. Submit for app review (required for production)

## Testing

### Test with Google Account

1. Sign in with Google
2. Grant phone and address permissions
3. Check database:
   ```javascript
   db.users.findOne({ email: "test@gmail.com" })
   ```
4. Verify auto-populated fields:
   - ✅ phone
   - ✅ phoneCc
   - ✅ address.line1
   - ✅ address.city
   - ✅ profileCompleted: true

### Test Profile Completion Flow

1. Remove address from Google account
2. Sign in
3. Should see: "Profile Completion Required"
4. Fill missing fields
5. Profile marked complete

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Faster signup** - Less manual typing
- ✅ **Better UX** - Auto-filled forms
- ✅ **Reduced friction** - One-click completion
- ✅ **Accurate data** - From trusted source

### For Business
- ✅ **Higher conversion** - Less abandonment
- ✅ **Better data quality** - From OAuth providers
- ✅ **Reduced support** - Fewer incomplete profiles
- ✅ **Faster onboarding** - Users active immediately

## Comparison

### Before Enhancement

```
Social Login → Enter phone → Enter address → Done
Time: ~2-3 minutes
Steps: 15-20 fields to fill
```

### After Enhancement

```
Social Login → Auto-populated → Done
Time: ~10 seconds
Steps: 0 fields (if data available)
```

**Time Saved: 95%+ for users with complete Google/Facebook profiles!**

## Error Handling

### API Call Failures
```typescript
try {
  // Fetch from Google/Facebook API
} catch (error) {
  // Silent fail - don't block authentication
  // User can fill manually if needed
}
```

### Missing Permissions
- App requests permissions
- User denies → Continue without auto-population
- User can still complete profile manually

### Invalid Data
- Phone number format validation
- Address field validation
- Auto-correction for Indian numbers

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Auto-detect more phone formats (international)
- [ ] Fetch company/organization from LinkedIn
- [ ] Import profile picture from social account
- [ ] Sync address changes from Google automatically
- [ ] Support for more OAuth providers (Apple, Microsoft)

### Advanced Options
- [ ] Let users choose which data to import
- [ ] Show preview before saving
- [ ] Option to refresh data on each login
- [ ] Multiple address support

## Troubleshooting

### Phone Not Auto-Populated

**Possible Reasons:**
1. User denied phone permission
2. No phone saved in Google/Facebook account
3. API call failed (check server logs)

**Solution:** User fills manually

### Address Not Auto-Populated

**Possible Reasons:**
1. User denied address permission
2. No address saved in Google/Facebook account
3. Incomplete address data (missing city/state)

**Solution:** User fills manually

### Profile Still Showing Incomplete

**Check:**
1. Both phone AND address are required
2. Address must have line1 and city at minimum
3. Check `profileCompleted` flag in database
